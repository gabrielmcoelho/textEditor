# Looqbox Editor

Looqbox editor is a code editor based in javascript. It uses Prism for highlight syntax and it is **CSP compliant**, which makes it a really good option since almost all other open source code editors don't work well when CSP is enabled. The editor can be easily embedded in your application, only requiring you to set up bootstrap, jquery and prism.
